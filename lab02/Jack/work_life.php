			<h2>Work Life</h2>
			<p>During my time at the University of Rochester, I have worked at a couple of different positions. During the summers, I worked at Lullaby Sound Design in Louisiana, which is a company that makes hand-made, tube amplifiers for guitars and violins. There I learned how to make these amplifiers and the different devices that were sold. During the academic years, I have also worked on campus as a CHM 132 Lab TA, which gave me a new perspective on the experiments, and I am currently a CSC 240/440 TA. Additionally, I am in the process of being hired for a student-worker position on campus, which I am excited for. </p>
