			<p>	I am a Mechanical Engineering major at the University of Rochester, and I am also minoring in Computer Science. I am very interested in how the world works, and I find both theoretical research and its application interesting. However, I decided to major in Mechanical Engineering because the idea of building something that could impact others interests me, which is why I also decided to minor in computer science. So far at UofR, I have taken the following courses: CSC 170, CSC 171, CSC 172, CSC 214, and CSC 240. Additionally, I have been a CHM 132 Lab Teacher Assistant, and I am currently a CSC 240/440 TA.
