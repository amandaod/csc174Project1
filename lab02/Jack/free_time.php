			<h2>Free Time</h2>
			<p>In my free time, I enjoy going on hikes, visiting parks, museums, and other activities. However, most of the time I spend outside of class and doing homework, I find myself learning things that interest me and participate in organizations on campus. Currently, I am learning how to play the guitar and how to build a self-balancing robot using arduino.
