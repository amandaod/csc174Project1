			<h2>Early Life</h2>
			<p>I am originally from Louisiana, but I moved around the state a lot. At the beginning of sophomore year of high school, I left my home to attend a public, boarding school in rural, northern Louisiana. My high school was very different from others in that its focus was academics and maintaining a positive public image (it was basically UofR). Therefore, while I volunteered a lot and did various other community service events, I was learning a lot about what I wanted to do. It was there, where I learned about careers in the sciences and began to think about what I wanted to do with my life. Three years later, I was faced with the decision to stay or leave Louisiana. In the end, I decided that there werenâ€™t many opportunities for me in Louisiana, and I eventually learned of the UofR. This campus offered me a different perspective on cultural, social, and political issues, which trully interested me. And here I am.
