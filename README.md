### Typography
To improve the typography, I chose a typeface more relevant to the page's content.  As the page is about programming languages, I chose the font Inconsolata, which was designed to be a good font for printing code.  I used this for headings and small pieces of texts and paired it with the typeface Noto Sans (which is more legible) for the paragraphs.

### Readability
To improve readability, I made the headings stand out more by putting them in their own column along the left.  This makes it easier to scan the text for these headings and find what each section is about.  I also increased the amount of space above each heading and paragraph so that each section of content (a paragraph and its descriptive heading) is more distinct.
