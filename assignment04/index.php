	<h3>The Evolution of Visual Entertainment</h3>

	<p>
		Theatre, Cinema and Television are forms of visual entertainment were the audience watches a show or a performance. They are different medias through which a story can be narrated and represented. Each form of entertainment makes use of technology to enhance the visual representations. Cinema and Television make the most use of technology such as CGI and Special Effect. However, Theatre too can incorporate modern technologies such as projectors and digital screens to astonish and further immerse the audience in the narration.

	<h3>Programming Languages</h3>

	<p>
		C, Python, and Java are programming languages have allowed for revolutionary developments in the programming field. Programming in general is beginning to become more prominent in society and these are the three languages that tend to be most common and the ones that people tend to learn first. C has been around since 1972 and was designed by Dennis Ritchie, Python has been around since 1990 and was designed by Guido van Rossum, and Java has been around since 1995 and was designed by James Gosling.

	<h3>Cute Cats</h3>

	<p>
		Below are three different animals belonging to the subfamily Felinae. These species were chosen because they are genetically similar, but are considered very different animals in common opinion. Additionally, these are the cutest cat-like species that I could find. F. catus is the common domesticated cat, L. pardinus is the Iberian Lynx, and P. concolor is a cougar. Although they are all related, they live in different habitats and live very different lives.
