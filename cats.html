	<h1>Cute Cats</h1>

	<p>
		I have decided to include three different animals belonging to the subfamily Felinae. These species were chosen because they are genetically similar, but are considered very different animals in common opinion. Additionally, these are the cutest cat-like species that I could find. F. catus is the common domesticated cat, L. pardinus is the Iberian Lynx, and P. concolor is a cougar. Although they are all related, they live in different habitats and live very different lives.
	<p>

	<h2>Felus catus - Common Cat</h2>

	<h3>Summary</h3>

	<p>
		The cat or domestic cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal.It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae. The cat is either a house cat, kept as a pet; or a feral cat, freely ranging and avoiding human contact. A house cat is valued by humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.
	</p>

	<h3>History</h3>

	<p>
		It was long thought that cat domestication was initiated in Egypt, because cats in ancient Egypt were venerated since around 3100 BC. However, the earliest indication for the taming of an African wildcat (F. lybica) was found in Cyprus, where a cat skeleton was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave dating to around 7500 BC. African wildcats were probably first domesticated in the Near East. The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed independently in China around 5500 BC, though this line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic cat populations of today.

	<h3>Impact on humans</h3>
	<p>
		As of 2007, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the U.S. by number of pets owned, after freshwater fish. As of 2010, it was ranked the third-most popular pet in the UK, after fish and dogs, with around 8 million being owned.

	<h2>Puma concolor - Cougar</h2>
	
	<h3>Summary</h3>

	<p>
		The cougar (Puma concolor), also commonly known as the puma, mountain lion, panther or catamount, is a large felid of the subfamily Felinae native to the Americas. Its range, from the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes of South America, is the widest of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere. An adaptable, generalist species, the cougar is found in most American habitat types. It is the biggest cat in North America, and the second-heaviest cat in the New World after the jaguar. Secretive and largely solitary by nature, the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular, although daytime sightings do occur. The cougar is more closely related to smaller felines, including the domestic cat (subfamily Felinae), than to any species of subfamily Pantherinae, of which only the jaguar is native to the Americas.
	</p>

	<h3>History</h3>

	<p>
		Intensive hunting following European colonization of the Americas and the ongoing human development of cougar habitat has caused populations to drop in most parts of its historical range. In particular, the North American cougar was extirpated in eastern North America in the beginning of the 20th century, except for the isolated Florida panther subpopulation.
	</p>

	<h3>Impact on humans</h3>

	<p>
		Transient males have been verified in Minnesota, Missouri, Iowa, Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois (where a cougar was shot in the city limits of Chicago), and in at least one instance, observed as far east as coastal Connecticut. Reports of eastern cougars (P. c. cougar) still surface, although it was declared extirpated in 2011.

	<h2>Lynx pardinus - Iberian Lynx</h2>

	<h3>Summary</h3>

	<p>
		The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is a wild cat species native to the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe that is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. It preys almost exclusively on the European rabbit. In the 20th century, the Iberian lynx population declined because of sharp declines in rabbit populations, caused by myxomatosis, rabbit haemorrhagic disease and overhunting, fragmentation of grassland and forest habitats and poaching.
	</p>

	<h3>History</h3>

	<p>
		Formerly considered a subspecies of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), the Iberian lynx is now classified as a separate species. Both species occurred together in Central Europe in the Pleistocene and evolved as distinct species in the Late Pleistocene. The Iberian lynx is thought to have evolved from Lynx issiodorensis.
	</p>

	<h3>Impact on humans</h3>

	<p>
		By the turn of the 21st century, the Iberian lynx was on the verge of extinction, as only about 100 individuals survived in two isolated subpopulations in Andalusia. Conservation measures implemented since 2002 included improving habitat, restocking of rabbits, translocating and re-introducing Iberian lynxes, so that by 2012 the population had increased to 326 individuals. As an attempt to save this species from extinction, projects under the EU LIFE Programme have undertaken habitat preservation, lynx population monitoring, and rabbit population management.
